# Lilia – Modules Collection

Official gameplay extensions for the [Lilia](https://github.com/LiliaFramework/Lilia) framework. Modules drop directly into your `lilia/modules/` folder and expand your RP experience with new mechanics, UI features and quality of life improvements.

---

## 📥 Downloading Modules

Browse all maintained modules on the [Lilia Modules site](https://liliaframework.github.io/Modules/). Select the addons you want and place them inside `lilia/modules/` on your server.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Modules with a `config.lua`
- **Location:** `lilia/modules/<module_name>/config.lua`
- **Override:** Copy the file to your schema's `config/` folder and edit the values. Restart the server to apply your changes.

### Modules without a `config.lua`
- Configure these from the in-game F1 settings tab. Some changes may require a map restart.

> 💡 *Tip:* If you're unsure whether a module has a `config.lua`, check its folder or look for settings in game via `?` and searching `lilia_<module>`.
